# Backtests
Variety of test and example files used within pre-liminary backtesting for equity etf's revolving around momentum trading
This collection of files are only an example of the backtests I have done and testing procedures used. They are not final products nor the complete code 
of software used and instead provide a small example of the tests and methodlogies used in construction of systematic strategies. Access to more complicated 
backtests involving paper and live data. Please contact me at haisun1997@gmail.com.
